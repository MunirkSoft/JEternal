# JEternal

JEternal project. A virtual "OS" (application looking like a real OS but not being one since requiring a real one for running) firstly published on github at May, Sunday 28th, 2018.
Due to how it looks, Virtual Desktop Manager would be a better name. But since it have it's own format (EEF and ESL), i just don't know how to name that.

Picture of it at one of it's first version, v381 (before YY.MM version system)
